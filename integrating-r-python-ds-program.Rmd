## Pedagogical challenges (and solutions!) for teaching both R & Python

**Problem 1:** Mixed proficiencies of previous R & Python programming skills between students

**Solution 1:** Optional questions to challenge more advanced students, and extra practice questions with feedback to support novices.

## Pedagogical challenges (and solutions!) for teaching both R & Python

**Problem 2:** Dual task interference

**Solution 2:** Learning outcomes in the program include comparing and contrasting the diffences between the languages (i.e., we spend a lot of time teaching and assessing whether the students know this).

## Pedagogical challenges (and solutions!) for teaching both R & Python

**Problem 3:** Memory decay during breaks in practice

**Solution 3:** All blocks in the program have courses that require students to use R & Python

# Take homes:

Tips for integrating R & Python into a Data Science program:

- Carefully choose tools that work well with both languages, and skip the ones that don't.

- Expect students to have a heterogeneous knowledge base that may differ between languages, and design exercises to address this.

- Teach the R'isms and the Python'isms and have the students compare and contrast them. Also, asses them on this!

- Structure the program so students repeatedly practice both languages, avoid gaps in one language if possible!
