## Integrating R & Python into a Data Science program

### Learning Objective - What will attendees learn from your talk?

- Pedagogical challenges (and strategies to manage them) for teaching both R and Python in a Data Science program
- Awareness of useful tools for working harmonioulsy with R and Python within a single data analysis

### Abstract
R and Python are arguably the two leading languages used in industry and academia for data analysis. Thus, to best prepare students in the University of British Columbia's course-based, professional Master of Data Science  (MDS) program to be competitive and perform in the job market we have made an explicit decision to have our program be bilingual and teach both the R and Python programming languages. 

Students are concurrently introduced to R and Python in the MDS in the first week of the program, and exposed and challenged to learn and do work in both of these languages for all 8 months of their coursework. In some courses, students learn the same skills in both languages (e.g., general programming, data wrangling, visualization, software development and packaging) and in other courses we specialize in one language in order to go more deeply into that topic (e.g., statistical inference in R, and machine learning in Python).
