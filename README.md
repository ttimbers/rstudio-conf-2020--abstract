## Integrating R & Python into a Data Science program

### Learning Objective - What will attendees learn from your talk?

- Pedagogical challenges (and strategies to manage them) for teaching both R and Python in a Data Science program
- Awareness of useful tools for working harmonioulsy with R and Python within a single data analysis

### Abstract
R and Python are arguably the two leading languages used in industry and academia for data analysis. Thus, to best prepare students in the University of British Columbia's course-based, professional Master of Data Science  (MDS) program to be competitive and perform in the job market we have made an explicit decision to have our program be bilingual and teach both the R and Python programming languages. 

Students are concurrently introduced to R and Python in the MDS
