### Learning Objective - What will attendees learn from your talk?

1. How we teach R & Python in a 10-month professional Data Science masters program at UBC. 
2. How we meet the pedagogical challenge of teaching both R & Python in a Data Science program, and strategies to navigate them. 
3. Tools for working harmoniously with R & Python within a single data analysis.

### Abstract
R and Python are the two leading languages used in industry and academia for data analysis. Thus, to best prepare students in the University of British Columbia's course-based, professional Master of Data Science (MDS) program to be competitive and perform on the job market we have made an explicit decision to have our program teach both the R and Python programming languages. 

Students are concurrently introduced to R and Python in the MDS in the first week of the program, and exposed and challenged to do work in both of these languages for all 8 months of their coursework. In some courses, students learn the same skills in both languages (e.g., general programming, data wrangling, visualization, software development and packaging) and in other courses we specialize in one language in order to go more deeply into that topic (e.g., statistical inference in R, and machine learning in Python). In the 2 month-long Capstone project at the end of the program, students are given free choice in the language they use to solve the data science problem for their project. 

In this talk we will discuss the pedagogical challenges we have encountered while teaching both R and Python in a Data Science program, and the strategies we have tried to implement to address them. We will also showcase key tools we have converged on teaching to our students that allow them to work harmoniously with R & Python within a single data analysis project. We will also discuss how we try to effectively teach them. These tools include reticulate, rpy2, the feather file format, Make and Docker.
